# README

This app takes advantage of the Spotify and Quantone API's enabling the user to
search for a song and find the musician credits (as well as production credits)
who participated in that song's recording (assuming the data is available on
Quantone). The user can then search any name of the recording credits to find
other works on which he or she has contributed.
